Test of opencv and pyqt generated from a .ui designer file

1) Made the UI with a GraphicsView, a Quit menu and a Capture button.

2) One way to do it; make the python with 
    pyuic5 -x test.ui -o test.py
   and base your code on that. Problem: you can't edit the UI again,
   because running pyuic5 again will overwrite any changes you make.
   
   Another idea: load the UI into the python. There's code to do
   this in basis.py, but basically you load the UI and then get
   references to widgets in it.
   
The code here works the second way - it requires that the app
bundles the .ui file, but that shouldn't be a problem. The .ui
file itself can be edited (rather nicely) in QtDesigner.
