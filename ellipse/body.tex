\section{Initial work}
First algorithm is this, which works on a small section of the image due to the
slowness of the Hough transform:
\begin{itemize}
\item convert to grayscale (this is a bit weird, it's
$0.299r+0.587g+0.144b$ to match human perception for want of anything else; ideally
it would use something appropriate to the filter being used)
\item Canny edge detect with fairly arbitrary thresholds, generating boolean array
\item convert to [0,255] unsigned bytes
\item perform Hough ellipse detection (takes a while)
\item discard ellipses with very small major/minor axes (i.e. almost-lines)
\item discard ellipses with a high eccentricity ($(a/b)-1 \ge 0.2$, where $a$ and $b$ are
the axis lengths)
\item get the best 100 results
\end{itemize}
