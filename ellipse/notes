Things we know that we can use:
there are multiple ellipses with the same (almost) major/minor axes and
orientation, but very different centres.

The centres and maj/minor axis lengths will have certain relationships which
must hold. How can we do this?

Find as many ellipses as you can (either with Hough or blob detection
or similar). This should give you maj/min axes, orientations and centroids (how you 
get some of these out of blobs I don't know).

Of these many ellipses, we need to find a subset which are in a
certain relationship. Some may not be present due to filtering (perhaps
we can work out different subsets based on which filter is used?)

The "obvious" method is to RANSACy - fit a 3D plane to groups of 3 centroids,
discarding those which can't possibly be right - or for each pair
of ellipses iterate over those which can possibly be in a valid plane.
For each plane, try to find ellipses which will be in a "correct"
relationship. This could be very slow?
